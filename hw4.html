          Creating the figure using only basic 2D shapes proved limiting, leading to a tedious and inefficient process. The realization that defining custom, reusable functions for components like eyes, arms, and the lower body was key to streamlining the development. This modular approach not only saved time but also likely made the code more manageable and adaptable. The desire to incorporate animation further reinforced the need for this more efficient and organized coding strategy.

        <p>
          Our group decided to go with a monster theme for this project and created figures that somewhat had qualities or features of a monster. This project evolved from a playful exploration of modular functions and character design into a meaningful endeavor, pushing me to refine the sketch's visual and interactive elements. While finding depth in a character born from an exquisite corpse exercise might seem unusual, recognizing its narrative potential fueled my motivation to craft a cohesive experience.

          I took on multiple roles, orchestrating the visual elements, interactive components, and overall storytelling like a director, producer, and conductor. This experience demonstrated how even simple visual principles like contrast, form, and motion, combined with a compelling narrative, can elevate a p5.js sketch. Also, I found our final figures very funny and interesting. The self-defined functions I learned were beneficial, too, especially in the future, when I have to design lines of code. The process inspired me on how to put together teamwork and how to create useful functions in p5.js.
