          This data portrait visualizes my actual daily usage of six different spices – Turmeric, Chili, Cumin, Coriander, Salt, and Garam Masala – over the course of a week. Each day is represented by a circle, arranged circularly around the canvas center. Concentric arcs emanate from each day's circle, with each color corresponding to a specific spice. The arc length represents the quantity of that spice used, creating a dial-like effect. The animated arcs grow to their full length, dynamically showcasing my spice usage.

          This visualization helped me realize I tend to use more warming spices like Turmeric and Garam Masala on some days, perhaps reflecting more elaborate cooking on those days, while other days the meals rely more heavily on Salt and Chili for simpler dishes. Visualizing this data made these patterns immediately apparent, something I hadn't consciously noticed before. While the dials do not show precise measurements, the visual representation effectively communicates the general trends in my spice usage, revealing subtle nuances in my cooking habits.
