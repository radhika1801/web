          Carnival Quest is a multi-stage arcade game featuring three engaging mini-games: Ball Catching, Balloon Pop, and Duck Pond. Players begin by selecting from three unique avatars and then progress through each game, honing their reflexes and precision. In the Ball Catching game, players use arrow keys to catch falling balls with a net, with increasing speed adding complexity. The Balloon Pop game challenges players to pop balloons with a dart using quick reflexes before time runs out. Finally, the Duck Pond game requires strategic timing to catch ducks with a net, revealing hidden prizes. With vibrant carnival-themed visuals and captivating sound effects, Carnival Quest offers a fun and challenging experience, with the opportunity to replay and improve scores.

        <p>
          Creating Carnival Quest was an enriching experience, blending creativity with technical skills. Designing three distinct mini-games challenged us to develop varied mechanics that engage players differentlyâ€”testing reflexes, precision, and strategy. Balancing difficulty and ensuring smooth transitions between games required careful planning and attention to detail. Adding sound and graphic elements significantly enhanced the overall experience, immersing players in the vibrant carnival atmosphere. This project improved my understanding of game design principles, user experience, and iterative development. Future enhancements could include additional features like leaderboards and customizable avatars, further enriching the player's journey.
